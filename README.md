# Make-Windows-Look-like-Macos
Full Pack of Making windows look like Macos, Including tutorial from TechRifle (I never asked techrifle for permission, So pls don't Sue me. I just want to make easier for people to make their desktops look like mac easier.)

Pack includes:
- Tutorial*
- SecureUX theme tool
- LIT3 For Windows
- BIB3 For Windows
- Techrifle's zip file to making it even easier
- StartAllBack
- Mydockfinder (Free Here.)
- Rainmeter
- Bluesh theme for Rainmeter

*The tutorial says to download the files from his website. Which I have already done for you. Also sometimes it leads you to unsafe websites. But don't worry. I have gone through the malware and the 404 not found pages. This is safe and you can easily make your desktop MacOS.
Good luck.
